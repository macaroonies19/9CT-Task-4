## Identifying and Defining
### Identifying a need
I want to create a Top Down RPG on unity. 
Brainstorm:
-Dungeon style game
-Defeat enemies to progress
-Invetory
-Collectable items
-Storyline
-Puzzles
-Memory (you will need to remember things earlier in the game to solve puzzles and progress)

Need:
My project will address the need for entertainment through an engaging and interactive game that also promotes problem solving and memory recall.

Problem Statement:
Lots of people especially young people like teens need entertainment and often play video games for this. This top down rpg filled with puzzles and memory recall in order to progress will challenge their brain and cognitive function while providing an entertaining gameplay.

Skill development: To develop the skills in Unity required to create the game, I would utilise tutorials on youtube and alike, and also get some help from ai.

### Requirements Outline
Inputs:
-Directional keyboard keys for character movement (WASD) and spacebar for jumping.
-Key to open inventory (E).
-Attack (LMB)
-Interact (RMB)

Processing:
-The program will check for collisions, and calculate the new position of the player when a movement key is detected.
-The program will open an interactable GUI when the inventory key is detected.
-The program will initiate an attack script based off the weapon equiped when the attack function is detected.
-The program will run an object specific script to load any puzzles/other interactble when the interact function is detected near an interactable object.

Outputs:
